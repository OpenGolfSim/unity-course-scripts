# OpenGolfSim Course Developer Toolkit

This repository contains our Unity package for editor and runtime scripts and assets for building courses for [OpenGolfSim](https://opengolfsim.com).

If you are new to course building, head over to our [help docs](https://help.opengolfsim.com) to learn more.

## How to use

Most users won't need to install this package directly. It's already included in our [Unity Project Template](https://github.com/OpenGolfSim/unity-project-template). However, may need to periodically update this package to the latest version within your Unity project using the **Package Manager**.

For advanced users, you can install this package into a Unity project using the Package Manager.

1. Open Unity's package manager by selecting **Window** > **Package Management** > **Package Manager**

2. Select the add package (`+`) button and select **Install package from git URL...**

3. Enter the following git repository url (including the `.git` extension):

    ```
    https://github.com/OpenGolfSim/unity-course-scripts.git
    ```
4. Click **Install**

5. You should now see a new **OpenGolfSim** menu under the **Tools** menu.
